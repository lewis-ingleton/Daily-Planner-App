# Daily-Planner-App

## What is this?
A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This task will include DOM manipulation, advanced JavaScript and integration of third-party APIs.

## Progress 
Unfinished. At time of writing more revision is required by myself in order to complete this task. Javascript and JQuery is something I've struggled with since I began learning about them but I will return to this assignment.
