# Daily-Planner-App

## What is this?
A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This task will include DOM manipulation, advanced JavaScript and integration of third-party APIs.

## Functionality / user story
As a user, I want a scheduler where I can note down my to-dos. I will write these to-dos in a row that corresponds to the time of day that I plan to do that particular task.

The scheduler has a colour code. For any row that is 
- Grey, it means the time of that row has passed
- Red, it means that is the current time so you should be working on the task in that row
- Green, it means these are times in the future, so these are your upcoming tasks 

## APIs
I have used the moment.js API to display the current date and time to the user. This API is the main component  of the functionality of this webpage, which I have described in the previous section.
